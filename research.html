    &emsp;This research is funded by the Postbaccalaureate Intramural Research Training Award given by the National
    Institutes of Health to fund young researchers who have finished their undergraduate studies and are in the process
    of applying to graduate school. I'm working with the Tromberg Lab on using near-infrared spectroscopy to correlate
    outcomes in patients with various medical conditions. I work directly with pediatric patients and optical measurement
    devices.

  &emsp;My research project, under the instruction and guidance of Professor Michael S. Inkpen in the
  <a style="color: skyblue" href=https://www.inkpenlab.org/>Inkpen Lab</a>, involves the synthesis of a
series of organic and organometallic molecules and subsequent exploration of their conductance at the single-molecule
scale using the scanning tunneling microscope-based break junction method.
Our key aim is to understand how the conductance of a simple conjugated organic ‘wire’ is modified
by an appended transition metal center. We call this modification approach ‘chemical gating’, by
analogy to the gate-modified current flow between source and drain terminals of a
transistor. Related concepts have been explored previously, in which redox-inactive organic
molecular wires were synthesized and measured. However, the charge transport process of
molecular wires with an appended metal site are considerably more complicated than that
of organic analogues, and in general there are insufficient data available for systems
containing metals. This project will provide useful new insights by exploring a novel family
of molecular electronic materials that is anticipated to exhibit unusual properties. For the work I have done with Prof. Inkpen,
I was awarded the 2019 and 2021 Provost Research Fellowship.

  Under the guidance of Professor Laurent Itti at the <a style="color: skyblue" href=http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/>USC iLabs</a>, I collected EEG data
  and designed a deep convolutional neural network to model the data. Data was collected via the
  <a style="color: skyblue" href=https://www.emotiv.com/epoc/>Emotiv EPOC headset</a>. We created a classification model which
  achieves around 96% accuracy for binary classification of sleepy versus awake brain activity, and around 93% accuracy for classification between sleepy, leisure,
  and focused brain activity. I was then invited to the <a style="color: skyblue" href=https://www.ncrc.hcura.org>Harvard National Collegiate Research Conference</a>,
  where I presented my research to a panel of judges and other students.

  This research project was sparked from a question a graduate student proposed to my professor, Prof. Erin P.J. Pearse,
  regarding the subsequence <i>a<sub>n</sub> = sin(n)<sup>n</sup></i>. The sine function is bound between 0 and 1, so one may
  expect that this subsequence tends towards zero as <i>n</i> becomes large. Strikingly, this is not the case; values arbitrarily
  close to one seem to appear forever throughout the sequence. Under the guidance of Prof. Pearse, I studied a similar, more general sequence:
  <i>a<sub>n</sub>=cos(n)<sup>n<sup>&gamma;</sup></sup></i>, for varying values of &gamma;. We proved that the <i>limsup</i> of this sequence
  is closely related to the irrationality measure of &pi;. In fact, for the set <i>&Phi; = {&gamma; &ge; 0 : limsup{|cos k|<sup>k<sup>&gamma;</sup></sup>}<sub>k &isin; &#8469;</sub> = 1}</i>
  we find that <i>sup &Phi; = 2&mu;(&pi;) - 2</i>, where &mu;(&pi;) is the irrationality measure of &pi;. We also provide further numerical evidence
  that &mu;(&pi;) = 2, as well as prove some fascinating facts about subsequences of a<sub>n</sub>. We find that for &gamma; < 2 &mu;(&pi;) - 2, there exist
  arithmetric progressions of arbitrary length whose values remain about &alpha; &isin; [0, 1). We prove certain bounds for the limsup of a<sub>n</sub> under
  various conditions. To see the full details of the paper, see the <a style="color: skyblue" href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02955>preprint</a> as well as
