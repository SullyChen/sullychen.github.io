  <img src="me.jpg" width="256" height=auto style="float:left; margin-right: 20px;">&emsp;My name is Sully Chen! I'm a 20 year old student
  studying biochemistry at the University of Southern California. I previously studied computer science at California Polytechnic University.
  I have a strong computer science and machine learning background, and started my first internship as a machine learning engineer at
  <a style="color: skyblue" href="https://www.parsehub.com/">ParseHub</a> shortly after turning 17. At ParseHub, I worked mainly on designing
  state-of-the-art artificial neural networks for encoding human-readable information into high-dimensional spaces. I used LSTMs trained on
  massive amounts of web data to generate random sample HTML web pages and encode data in TensorFlow.

  <br><br>&emsp;
  After my time at Parsehub, I entered my senior year in high school and spent a few months working on autonomous
  vehical related research, during which I created my popular <a style="color: skyblue" href="https://github.com/SullyChen/Autopilot-TensorFlow">
  GitHub repository</a>, which is an implementation of a <a style="color: skyblue" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf">paper by Nvidia</a>. This repository and dataset are cited in numerous academic
  research papers across the world and frequently appear in lectures and online courses. The popularity of this repository landed me
  interviews at several software companies, including <a style="color: skyblue" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">Nvidia</a>, <a style="color: skyblue" href="https://getcruise.com/">Cruise</a>, and <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/"
  style="color: skyblue">Leap Motion</a>. Though I received offer packages from both
  Nvidia and Leap Motion, I ultimately decided to join Leap Motion, where I worked from my senior year through my freshman year at
  Cal Poly.

  <br><br>&emsp;
  During my time at Cal Poly as a CS major, I actually didn't take a single computer science course. Instead, I spent this time enrolling in
  as many mathematics courses as I could, captivated by the beauty. By the end of that year I had written a mathematics paper under
  the guidance of Professor Erin P.J. Pearse, and was strongly considering pursuing a degree
  in mathematics. Ultimately my long-standing passion for medicine drove me to transfer to the University of Southern California to
  study biochemistry. I felt that biochemistry would give me a broad background in the natural sciences and research before I hopefully
  attend medical school. During my time at USC (where I am currently in my junior year), I have been involved in a couple research projects,
  winning several awards and presenting at Harvard. See my <a style="color: skyblue" href="research.html">research page</a> for more information!

  <br><br>&emsp;
  Though I am studying biochemistry and currently have plans to pursue an M.D., I have a strong computer science background and hope to unite
  my passions through research. I am particularly interested in how advances in machine learning can be applied to preventative medicine, as well
  as how to develop better computer-based tools to assist physicians. I'm also fascinated by regenerative medicine and ways to give those who
  suffer from disability more control over their lives. Though I have little experience in this field, I strive to gain a better understanding
  and contribute to the world when I hopefully attend medical school.
